* For myself
- Install ecukes
- Create que project properly
- Have fun

* Disclaimer
This library is (at this time) experimental and in developement.


* Keybingings.  

This library ships without any keybindings configured to allow you to pick and choose what commands are important to you and which keybindigs you want to use.

I use it with =M-r= as the prefix and then a mnemnoc key such as =M-r l= for Extract Let.

* Refactorings for Ruby
